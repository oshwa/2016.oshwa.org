<p>We&#8217;ve had a huge community request to host a Summit on the West Coast. We heard you! It&#8217;s happening!&nbsp; We are thrilled that this years Open Hardware Summit will be happening right in the prime of Portland, Oregon.</p>



<p>Just across from the venue is Powell&#8217;s Bookstore, which is famous for being the &nbsp;largest independent chain of bookstores in the world, and when you visit the flagship shop,&nbsp;<em>Powell&#8217;s</em>&nbsp;City of&nbsp;<em>Books</em>, you&#8217;ll need a map, it really is a city. We aren&#8217;t kidding. PDX is also famous for it&#8217;s food cart culture. From the posse at SW 10th Ave. and Alder St.,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.khaomangai.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nong&#8217;s Khao Man Gai</a>&nbsp;cart is not to be missed: utilizing the make-one-thing-but-make-it-great approach, Nong, a Bangkok native, offers&nbsp;<em>khao man gai,</em>&nbsp;an amazing Thai chicken dish which is to DIE FOR. Then there is Voodoo Donuts- its where the donut culture started.</p>



<p>Leading up to the Summit we will be posted suggestions on what to see in the city of Roses. See you in October!</p>
